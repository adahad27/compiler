This project was started on June 7th 2025.

The goal of this project is to create a compiler in Rust that is capable of compiling a subset of C.
More updates to the goal will be added as the scope of the project becomes clear.

Features of the language (either already implemented or planned):
1. Support for int, bool, and char primitive types
2. Support for arithmetic, boolean, and relational operators
3. Support for conditional and loop statements
